1. Open your IDE of preference (pycharm, spyder, Jupyter Notebook, etc.); start a new file

2. Import sys and run the following: `print(sys.path)`; this provides the locations in which your python
instance looks for packages - there will likely be one that ends or almost ends in site-packages

3. Open your file explorer and go to the directory location that ends in something similar to
*\Python\Python37-32\Lib\site-packages or *\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages

4. Download and move the entire "ML_DataPipeline" directory (the directory and the files inside)
contained in our repository to the above aforementioned folder (see step 3)

5. Download the data files from the drive and place them in the folder that you are doing your
project development in (ideally a cloned version of this repository). When you want to use the
DataPipeline just import it as if it were a regular module using one of:
"from ML_DataPipeline import DataPipeline", "from ML_DataPipeline import *", or "import ML_DataPipeline"
